				QuickDefinition
APP description

Problem: There are so many dictionaries. But it is difficult to searching for a dictionary and get the meaning or pronunciations. 
Solution: So I came up with a solution to this. It is the Quick Definition. This is an android app, which helps us to search the definitions for the given word. Moreover, we can listen to the correct pronunciation of the words with preferred language.
