Problem: Lifestyles of all people have become more complex today world. As students, we have to do more extra things more than academic load. Therefore, it is difficult to remind the subject matters easily. If we can review the things in our mind, it is easy and efficient to remind all the things.


Solution: So I came up with a solution to this. It is the SmartClassRoom. This is an android app, which helps us to revision the things, which we learned before. We can go through the questions by selecting the subject we want. Then we can expert in an area on any subject. But we need the questions according to the our module courses. Therefore, I hope to give questions relevant to the courses. This app will not depend on an eternal source. I hope to give SQLite Database with some questions and answers.
